**Top Of The Morning Lads**

"CODING IS EASY" - This is the most honest lie that bothers me and it all begins with DSA, the ruthless gatekeeper to all interviews, all opportunities. 

I admit I am not the best, nor the fastest, nor even the brightest of coders out here, but while I explore my journey trying to be-friend this scary beast called DSA and his minion questions, maybe, you too can find your way into loving DSA (if not, well, atleast clear those interviews). So here is my journal of the adventures I have with these imaginary monsters: **-**

# **A journey of tackling DSA questions while trying to keep sanity**
 
In this journal, I will keep posting solved approaches for questions in leetcode, interviewbit, geeksforgeeks (anywhere where that question shows up) along with the links to the solutions in which I explain my understanding of the question as someone who accepts DSA is not fun. However its not a random series of questions. The goal is to be-friend these imaginary monsters, so I will be systematic in my approach.

Here is how I am approaching DSA:
1. Bit Manipulation
2. Maths
3. Arrays
4. Strings
5. HashMaps
6. Two Pointers
7. Binary Search
8. Sliding Window
9. Recursion
10. Stacks
11. Linked Lists      --> I AM HERE NOW!!!

Planned, don't know if it will remain the same
1. Queues
2. Backtracking
3. Trees
4. Heaps/ Priority Queues
5. 1D DP
6. 2D DP
7. Graphs
8. Greedy
9. FINAL BOSSES

Cheers,

Your Struggling COder;
