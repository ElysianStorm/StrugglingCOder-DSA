"CODING IS EASY" - This is the most honest lie that bothers me and it all begins with DSA, the ruthless gatekeeper to all interviews, all opportunities. 

I admit I am not the best, nor the fastest, nor even the brightest of coders out here, but while I explore my journey trying to be-friend this scary beast called DSA and his minion questions, maybe, you too can find your way into loving DSA (if not, well, atleast clear those interviews). So here is my journal of the adventures I have with these imaginary monsters: **-**

# **A journey of tackling DSA questions while trying to keep sanity**
 
In this journal, I will keep posting solved approaches for questions in leetcode, interviewbit, geeksforgeeks (anywhere where that question shows up) along with the links to the solutions in which I explain my understanding of the question as someone who accepts DSA is not fun. However its not a random series of questions. The goal is to be-friend these imaginary monsters, so I will be systematic in my approach.

Here is how I am approaching DSA:
- [Bit Manipulation](#BIT-MANIPULATION)
- Maths
- Arrays
- Strings
- HashMaps
- Two Pointers
- Binary Search
- Sliding Window
- Recursion
- Stacks
- Linked Lists
- Trees      --> I AM HERE NOW!!!

Planned, don't know if it will remain the same
- Queues
- Backtracking
- Heaps/ Priority Queues
- 1D DP
- 2D DP
- Graphs
- Greedy
- FINAL BOSSES

Cheers,

Your Struggling COder;

## **BIT MANIPULATION**

<details>
 <summary>Bit Manipulation: The first/last step</summary>
 
Bit Manipulation surely isn't the first thing that comes to people's mind when they want to start there DSA journey (and I did agree to it till a long time), but I have come to realise if done first, it builds in a practice to code in the most optimized way in the long run. Since bit manipulation works closest to the machine, it speeds up the algorithms significantly faster.

In my experience bit manipulation has opened for me avenues in places where dumber me would have never thought to use it (binary search, powers of twos, masking, simple loops and much more). So, without any further ado, lets dig in what we need to learn in bit manipulation before we head to the questions (This is sort of classwork before doing homework, yeah poor example but its true).

1. Operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Left Shift, Right Shift)
2. Decimal -> Binary
3. Binary -> Decimal
4. Addition/Subtraction on bits
5. Odd/Even numbers
6. Swap two numbers
7. Bit Masking
8. Find ith bit
9. Set ith bit
10. Clear ith bit
11. Find number of bits to convert number A to number B

These questions set us up for bit manipulation, with these questions we know mostly how to deal with bits (mostly cause some questions are designed to fail your logic). Now we can dive in the depths of our homework.
A sweet search in CHAT-GPT gives this roadmap for bit manipulation along with some practice questions (yeah, I rely on chat-gpt):
